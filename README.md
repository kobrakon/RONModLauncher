# RON Mod Launcher
## A simple lightweight mod launcher for Ready Or Not
This is just a simple console-based mod launcher for Ready Or Not designed so that you can use mods without risking losing game files 
and still go back to vanilla whenever you like. Simply run the exe, wait for the console to seek the game path (it may need help if it
can't auto find it), and then go to the "modcontent" folder in the games root folder and place your mods in their appropriate catergories.
When you run the launcher, it simply saves the game files that are going to be replaced, and then moves your mod content into their appropriate
folders. Then, when the game ends, all mod content is placed back into the modcontent folder and the game files are returned.
The idea is that you can have a launcher that allows you to run mods, and then simply go back to loading it from Steam to be back to vanilla.
## Features PAK loading, VO loading, and FMOD loading
Remember, if you have an issue and would like for it to be patched, make a new issue issue thread if one doesn't exist already, or keep track of an existing thread;
I try to keep up with them as best as I can.
